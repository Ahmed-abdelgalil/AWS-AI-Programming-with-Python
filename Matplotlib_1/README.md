### qualitative(categorical) VS. quantitative(numeric) variables

| Aspect                    | Qualitative (Categorical) Variables            | Quantitative (Numeric) Variables       |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Nature                    | Represent categories or labels                | Represent quantities or measurements |
| Subtypes                  | Nominal (no order) and Ordinal (ordered)     | Discrete (distinct values) and Continuous (range of values) |
| Examples                  | Gender, Colors, Types of Fruits               | Number of Students, Height, Temperature |
| Measurement              | No numerical value associated                 | Have numerical values                 |
| Order                     | No inherent order (Nominal), Meaningful order (Ordinal) | Numerical values have order          |
| Differences between values | Differences are not meaningful (Nominal), May have inconsistent differences (Ordinal) | Consistent and meaningful differences |
| Statistical Analysis     | Frequencies, Mode, Chi-Square (Nominal)       | Mean, Median, Range, Variance (Continuous) |
|                     | Mean, Median, Mode, Range (Ordinal)           | Frequencies, Histogram (Discrete)     |
| Examples of Analysis      | Counting occurrences, percentage distributions (Nominal) | Averages, distribution shapes, correlations (Continuous) |
|                         | Comparing proportions, testing associations   | Statistical inference, regression     |

### absolute frequency VS. relative frequency:

| Aspect                   | Absolute Frequency                         | Relative Frequency                             |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Definition               | Count of occurrences of a value/category  | Proportion/percentage of occurrences relative to the total |
| Calculation              | Number of times a value/category appears  | \(\frac{\text{Absolute Frequency}}{\text{Total Number of Observations}}\) |
| Focus                    | Raw count of occurrences                  | Distribution of values, accounting for dataset size |
| Notation                 | Usually expressed as a whole number       | Expressed as a decimal or percentage          |
| Example                  | Number of students with a score of 80     | Proportion of students with a score of 80 out of total students |
| Purpose                  | Describing the frequency of specific values | Comparing distributions across datasets of different sizes |

### Glossary
1. **Univariate visualizations**: Visualize single-variables, such as bar charts, histograms, and line charts.
2. **Bivariate visualizations**: Plots representing the relationship between two variables measured on the given sample data. These plots help to identify the relationship pattern between the two variables.
3. **Ordinal data**: It is a categorical data type where the variables have natural and ordered categories. The distances between the categories are unknown, such as the survey options presented on a five-point scale.
